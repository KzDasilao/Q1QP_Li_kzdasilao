        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <div class="conclusion2">
        <p3>According to the data we collected, women outnumber males when it comes to buying. 
            The findings show that clothing was chosen as the most favored product by customers 
            in the product category. According to Forbes (2013), women dominate the shopping 
            industry because "women have primary caregiving responsibilities," which causes "women 
            to find themselves buying on behalf of everyone else in their lives." It is understandable 
            why clothing was chosen as the highest in the product category because clothing is a necessity 
            for us. According to Fibre2Fashion (2006), clothing is necessary "to protect it against adverse 
            climate conditions." Apart from being a need, it enhances our beauty and boosts our self-esteem.
            This is relevant to businesses. Salespeople can use this as a tool to observe consumer preferences 
            for what they would buy or products in high demand. This information can be used to 
            forecast future product preferences. This can assist firms in estimating product demand,
             managing inventories, and making strategic decisions to efficiently meet their consumers' requests.
